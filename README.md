# Target-Classification-in-Radar-using-Deep-Learning
"Target Classification in Radar using deep learning" is a project that aims to leverage the capabilities of deep learning algorithms to classify and identify targets detected by radar systems. Radar is a technology used for detecting and tracking objects by emitting radio waves and analyzing the reflected signals. The project focuses on developing a deep learning model, typically implemented using frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, to process the radar data and accurately classify the detected targets into different categories, such as vehicles, man, group of men, or other relevant classes. By utilizing deep learning, the project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of target classification in radar systems, which can have significant applications in various fields, including surveillance, autonomous vehicles, aerospace, and defence.
